# PhotCluster
We have created a code to do the photometry of clusters and astronomical structures, using different observation images and filters.
The user should put all the .fits files in the same folder that he puts the .py file. The isochrones .txt file is obtained in http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/cmd_3.3 and the user should clear the first # (in the line where the parameters names are).
